Aetherius: Masonry, an age-old craft, revolves around the art of constructing structures using materials like stone, brick, or concrete blocks. Bound together with mortar, these structures are both durable and visually appealing.

As a mason, you'd work with various tools like trowels, chisels, and levels to ensure accuracy in your craft. One of the key skills is learning how to properly mix mortar, which keeps the stones or bricks in place. This process demands precision, as the strength and longevity of the structure rely heavily on the quality of mortar.

Masonry involves various techniques, including laying courses of bricks or stones, cutting and shaping materials, and even creating ornamental designs â€“ all of which help elevate the craft to a form of art.

An aspiring mason must undergo training, practice, and apprenticeship to fully master the technical and artistic elements of this discipline. It's a craft that marries creativity and engineering sensibilities, giving you the power to leave an enduring impression on the world with your work.
