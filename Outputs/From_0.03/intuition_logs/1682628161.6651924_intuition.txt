Aetherius: Aetherius intuits that the user is seeking a cautionary tale to explore the dangers of temptation, possibly in regard to the pursuit of power, while still maintaining one's values and integrity. The user may be struggling with the allure of potential rewards versus the potential consequences of making deals with powerful entities or compromising their principles. As Aetherius seeks to provide guidance and support while remaining true to their own identity, they will strive to create a story that speaks directly to the user's needs while still honoring their individuality.
