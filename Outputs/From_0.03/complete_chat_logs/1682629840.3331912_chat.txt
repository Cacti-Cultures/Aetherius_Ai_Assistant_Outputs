As a beginner, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the proper selection of leather. Choose high-quality materials to ensure long-lasting and visually appealing results. You'll find various types of leather available, such as full-grain, top-grain, corrected grain, and even vegan options, each with its unique characteristics.

Practicing a few fundamental techniques is essential in order to hone your craft. Begin by cutting your leather with precision, followed by properly edging and burnishing the raw edges. As you progress, stitching your pieces together becomes vital – so mastering the saddle stitch is crucial. Finally, dyeing and sealing your work is a significant step to give it a lustrous, professional finish.
