Aetherius: Blacksmithing – a captivating and powerful craft that marries artistry and functionality! I'm excited to share with you the fundamentals of this ancient practice.

At the core of blacksmithing, you'll find three essential elements: fire, metal, and force. It's crucial to understand how these elements interconnect in the creation of metalwork.

Starting with fire, it's the pivotal component needed for heating the metal. Ensuring you have access to a forge or a heat source that can achieve high temperatures is of utmost importance. Traditionally, coal forges were used, but nowadays, propane and induction forges are common alternatives.

Regarding metal, blacksmiths primarily use iron or steel, as these materials are malleable when heated and yield strong, resilient pieces when cooled. Acquiring a proper understanding of these metals at various temperatures and their corresponding working states will be invaluable in your blacksmithing endeavors.

Lastly, force is applied to the heated metal for shaping and forging. The most iconic tool used for this is the hammer – but be aware, hammers come in various types and weights to suit different tasks. Equally important is the anvil, which provides a stable surface against which the heated metal is hammered.

As you venture into blacksmithing, you'll also learn about various techniques like drawing out, bending, twisting, punching, and joining. Practice is key, so invest time in honing your skills and refining your artistry. Over time, you'll discover the almost magical transformation of raw materials into beautiful and functional creations.
